## System Architecture

- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.4.0
- **Typography**: Google Fonts (Poppins family)

### Backend Architecture

- **Structure**: Simple single-module application with main app logic in `app.py`
- **Entry Point**: `main.py` serves as the application entry point
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration for session secrets

### Frontend Features
- Responsive navigation with direct menu access (no dropdowns)
- Large, prominent logo with responsive scaling (80px to 140px)
- Scroll-triggered animations and fade effects
- Smooth scrolling navigation with section targeting
- Newsletter form functionality with validation

## Data Flow

### Current Implementation
1. **Static Content Delivery**: Flask serves static files (CSS, JS, images) and renders HTML templates
2. **Template Rendering**: Jinja2 processes templates with Flask's `render_template()` function
3. **Client-Side Interactions**: JavaScript handles animations, scroll effects, and form interactions

### Future Extensions
- Contact form will need backend processing and data storage
- Newsletter subscription will require email service integration
- Potential database integration for content management

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Bootstrap 5.3.0**: CSS framework for responsive design
- **Font Awesome 6.4.0**: Icon library
- **Google Fonts (Poppins)**: Typography

### Python Dependencies
- **Flask**: Web framework
- **Standard Library**: `os` for environment variables, `logging` for debugging

## Deployment Strategy

### Current Configuration
- **Host**: Configured to run on `0.0.0.0` (all interfaces)
- **Port**: 5000
- **Debug Mode**: Enabled for development
- **Session Management**: Uses environment variable for session secret with fallback

### Production Considerations
- Debug mode should be disabled in production
- Session secret should be properly configured via environment variables
- Static file serving should be handled by a web server (nginx/Apache) in production
- WSGI server (like Gunicorn) recommended for production deployment

### Architecture Decisions

**Problem**: Need for professional corporate website with modern design
**Solution**: Flask + Bootstrap combination for rapid development and responsive design
**Rationale**: 
- Pros: Quick setup, responsive design out-of-the-box, extensive component library
- Cons: Dependency on CDN resources

**Problem**: Scalable CSS architecture
**Solution**: CSS custom properties (variables) for consistent theming
**Rationale**:
- Pros: Easy theme customization, maintainable color scheme, consistent styling
- Cons: Limited browser support for very old browsers

**Problem**: Interactive user experience
**Solution**: Vanilla JavaScript with scroll animations and smooth transitions
**Rationale**:
- Pros: No additional framework dependencies, lightweight, good performance
- Cons: More code required compared to using a JavaScript framework

The application follows a traditional server-side rendered architecture suitable for a corporate marketing website, with room for future expansion into more dynamic functionality.
